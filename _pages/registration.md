Registration to the Bonsai Conference is free, but we have limited places available for in-person attendance. If we have more in-person applications than available space we will select applicants based on their fit to the conference. When filling out the registration form, please tell us why you are interested in the conference.

[**Register here**](https://forms.office.com/e/JE8DMXaM38)

If you have registered and need a visa to come to the UK, please apply for a Standard Visitor visa. More details regarding the visa application can be found [here](https://www.gov.uk/standard-visitor). If you need an invitation letter for your visa application, please [contact us](mailto:{{ site.email }}).

We will live stream most of the conference via Zoom and will publish a link closer to the date.
