Below are a few options for accommodation within walking distance of the conference venue:

[Gem Langham Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/hYVnjKQnFMHpYYbbA)  
[Holiday Inn – Regents Park](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EMsncewWBaRySbGp6)  
[Holiday Inn – Bloomsbury](https://maps.app.goo.gl/C7axG1QsTwULdUHY9)  
[Radison Blu Hotel](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3BXs7PdAsprYK879A)  

The Bonsai Developer Conference does not endorse any of these accommodations. There are plenty of offers available in London and you are free to choose other more convenient alternatives.
