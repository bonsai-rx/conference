### Present and Future of Bonsai

**Moderators**: @glopesdev @PathogenDavid @jfrazao

**Abstract**: Present and discuss the current state of the language, compiler, IDE, and standard library

### Documentation

**Abstract**: TBD

### Machine Learning

**Moderators**: @ncguilbeault

**Abstract**: 

Bonsai is a powerful reactive programming language, especially in neuroscience
for data acquisition and closed-loop experimentation.
Typically, neuroscientists use Bonsai for acquisition but rely on other
programming languages, such as Python and MATLAB, for offline processing with
machine learning (ML) algorithms.
This approach can be labor-intensive and inefficient, requiring substantial
time and resources, such as extensive data storage.

Recently, we have started adding ML functionality to Bonsai by developing
packages that interface with powerful ML tools for online data analysis.
The goal of the Bonsai.ML project is to infuse Bonsai with ML capabilities,
further enhancing closed-loop experiments with intelligent online analyses and
control, while simultaneously improving the efficiency of the data acquisition
and processing loop.

In this session, we will:

- Discuss the basics of online probabilistic machine
learning, the backbone of Bonsai.ML packages.
- Introduce several Bonsai.ML methods, providing examples and tutorials on
their implementation in Bonsai.
- For each method, provide a high-level introduction to statistical concepts
important for understanding the method, and run hands-on tutorials using
simulated data, as well as behavioural and neural data.

A tentative schedule for the Bonsai.ML session follows:

1. Introduction to the Bonsai.ML project
2. Introduction to online machine learning
3. Theory: unsupervised learning with linear dynamical systems (LDSs)
    - Practical: inferring kinematics of foraging mice
4. Theory: unsupervised classification with hidden Markov models (HMMs)
    - Practical: inferring behavioural syllables of foraging mice
5. Theory: supervised regression with online Bayesian linear regression
    - Practical: predicting visit duration of foraging mice
6. Theory: decoding behaviour from neural activity using state-space models
    - Practical: decoding replay from neural activity in the hippocampus of
rats
